</p>

The wizard guides users through structured service request flows and generates normalized payloads ready for automation pipelines.

---

## 🧠 Overview

Organizations frequently receive requests through unstructured channels such as contact forms, email, or messaging platforms. These entry points often produce inconsistent or incomplete information, creating operational friction.

**LeadFlow Wizard** introduces a guided intake layer that structures requests before they reach operational teams.

Key goals:

- reduce manual triage  
- standardize incoming request data  
- enable workflow automation  
- route requests to the correct operational teams  
- generate structured data for analytics

E --> F[Data Normalization]
F --> G[(Database)]
G --> H[Operations Team]
H --> I[Follow Up]
```

### System Flow

1. User accesses the intake wizard  
2. Selects the request type  
3. Fills guided form fields  
4. Data is sent via webhook  
5. Automation engine processes the request  
6. Data is normalized  
7. Request is routed to the appropriate team  

---

## 🛠 Service Flows
